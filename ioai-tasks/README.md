# IOAI Task Portfolio

This folder contains some machine learning projects I completed while preparing for the International Olympiad in Artificial Intelligence (IOAI). Each task represents a different problem domain.

### 📁 Projects

- [`tricy-table-data`](./tricy-table-data): Imputing missing tabular data using time-dependent statistics and LightGBM.
- [`radar`](./radar): U-Net segmentation on radar heatmaps to detect human presence.
- [`association-word-guessing`](./association-word-guessing): NLP task with a twist: negative training to correct worst-case guesses.
