# IOAI Task Portfolio

This folder contains some machine learning projects I completed while preparing for the International Olympiad in Artificial Intelligence (IOAI). Each task represents a different problem domain, model type, and engineering challenge.

### 📁 Projects

- [`tabular-time-imputation`](./tabular-time-imputation): Imputing missing tabular data using time-dependent statistics and LightGBM.
- [`radar-segmentation`](./radar-segmentation): U-Net segmentation on radar heatmaps to detect human presence.
- [`association-word-guessing`](./association-word-guessing): NLP task with a twist: negative training to correct worst-case guesses.
