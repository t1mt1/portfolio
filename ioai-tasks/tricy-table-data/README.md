# Time-Aware Imputation for Damaged Tabular Data

This project explores a regression task with heavily damaged and incomplete tabular data, tackled during my preparation for the International Olympiad in Artificial Intelligence (IOAI).

The dataset contains numeric features and timestamp-like fields (`day`, `hour`, `minute`). The evaluation metric is squared RMSE.

## 🧠 Key Idea

Many features showed **time-dependent patterns**, with standard deviation varying across `(day, hour)` groups. I leveraged this structure to impute missing values **only in the test set**, using per-hour group means.

## 🛠️ Techniques Used

- Time-based feature imputation
- Gradient boosting with LightGBM
- Power transforms to align with evaluation metric (`target**0.25` for training, then inverted via `x**4`)
- Relative standard deviation analysis to identify temporal structure
